# Command for YHCN
This repo include all command would use on YHCN.
Until now, we have some mind with it:
1. [init_YHCN](plinit/README.md)
2. [upload Cockpit's plugs](upplug/README.md)
3. [create Virtual Machine](vmcreate/README.md)
4. ......

We are trying to use `Shell` `Python` `Go` or any programming language to do so.
Any ideas will be considered, please contact the repo manager
